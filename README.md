============

This is the front end for project Angelika. This was a [customer driven project (TDT4290)](http://www.idi.ntnu.no/emner/tdt4290/) at [NTNU](http://www.ntnu.edu/).

Other components of the system:

* [angelika-api](https://github.com/sigurdsa/angelika-api)
* [angelika-hub](https://github.com/torgeha/angelika-hub)

# Getting started

* `cp js/static.js.example to js/static.js`
